                    behavioral health disorder, family conflict, or incorrigibility. Adults who are in need of a

                    problems, an interruption in the ability to learn age appropriate coping skills and/or daily living

                    All clients will be assessed for admissions to Mercy4Care, LLC without regard to race or religious

                    mutually agreeable treatment goals and objectives. Any adult who presents as actively a danger to
                    themselves or others will not be admitted to our program. These individuals will be referred to
                    Mercy Care Crisis Team and/or local law enforcement. The Executive Director and/or Clinical Director
                    shall ensure that clients that are accepted for admission can be appropriately treated under the

                Any agency or individual requesting re-admission of a client to our program, after discharge, will be
                required to go through our intake/admission process to determine eligibility based on the clients
                behavioral health needs.
            </div>
            <h3 class="text-purple pt-2">Waiting List</h3>
            <div class="text-md-left">
                Admissions will be authorized by the Clinical Director or the Executive Director. Any outside agency
                requesting emergency placement in our program will be addressed immediately. AZ Care 4 Life may decline
                services if the individual being referred is actively homicidal or suicidal. In the event a bed is not
                available; the client can be placed on a waiting list, or AZ Care 4 Life will work together with the
                referring agency or individual requesting services to find alternative community resources. Individuals
                placed on a waiting list will be on a first come, first served basis.
            </div>
            <h3 class="text-purple pt-2">Referral</h3>
            <div class="text-md-left">
                All outside agencies requesting placement for their client will be required to submit a referral packet.
                Mercy4Care Life will notify requesting agency within 24 hours after submission of referral packet to
                verify receipt of information. In the event that additional information is required, the requesting
                agency will be notified within 48 hours of original packet submission. Upon receipt of a completed
                referral packet the requesting agency will be notified 24 to 48 hours of our intent to treat, or a
                written denial of services. In the event that an individual is found to have behavioral health needs
                beyond our scope of services; Mercy4Care will not accept this client and will assist in locating another
                agency that can meet the client’s needs. Any individual requesting services for a child who is not
                currently enrolled with the RBHA, and is eligible for such enrollment, will be referred for an Intake
                with Mercy Care. No individual will ever be denied services due to inability.

                At intake we assess the level of severity of the adult and family who have been referred or have
                self-referred. At intake, client/family evaluation is completed for a client who meets Mercy4Care
                admission criteria.

            <h3 class="text-purple pt-2">Discharge</h3>
            <div class="text-md-left">
                A client will be voluntarily discharged when they have achieved their treatment goals as documented in
                the client’s treatment plan and are able to demonstrate the desired skills as mutually determined by the
                client, legal guardian or representative and the AZ Care 4 Life Clinical Director or his/her designee.
                At the time of discharge or transfer a client will receive a referral for treatment or ancillary
                services if determined as necessary by the Clinical Director.
            </div>
            <h3 class="text-purple pt-2">Involuntary Discharge</h3>
            <div class="text-md-left">
                This will occur when the client’s behavioral health issues or treatment needs are not consistent with
                the services our agency is authorized to provide. Clients who are unwilling to engage in treatment
                and/or program policies may also be discharged. This may include, but is not limited to: verbal/physical
                assault/abuse of staff or other client’s, or disruptive behaviors which interfere with the treatment
                needs of other clients in the program. AZ Care 4 Life will ensure that if a client is involuntarily
                discharged that attempts are made to secure alternative placement/services or resources in the
                community.
